=head1 NAME

EBook::MOBI::Picture - Make sure that pictures cope with the MOBI standards.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use EBook::MOBI::Picture;
  my $p = EBook::MOBI::Picture->new();
    
  my $img_path_small = $p->rescale_dimensions($img_path_big);

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

The code is meant to be used in object oriented style, so you are asked to create an object before using.

  my $p = EBook::MOBI::Picture->new();

=head2 rescale_dimensions

According to my own research at the web, it is a good idea to have a maximum size for images of 520 x 622. And this is what this method does, it ensures that this maximum is kept.

Pass a path to an image as the first argument, you will then get back the path of a rescaled image. The image is only rescaled if necessary.

Attention: All pictures, no matter what size will be converted to JPG. In my tests, the Kindle-Reader failed to display PNG, that is why I convert everything - to go safe.

=head2 debug_on

You can just ignore this method if you are not interested in debuging!

Pass a reference to a debug subroutine and enable debug messages.

=head2 debug_off

Stop debug messages and erease the reference to the subroutine.

=head1 TODO

A method to 'clean up' and also to change the maximum values would be nice.
